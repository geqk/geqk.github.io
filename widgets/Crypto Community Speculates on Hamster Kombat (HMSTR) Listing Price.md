# Crypto Community Speculates on Hamster Kombat (HMSTR) Listing Price  

As the countdown to the HMSTR token listing by Hamster Kombat approaches, anticipation continues to build within the crypto community. Scheduled for a high-profile debut on major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and OKX, the initial trading price of HMSTR remains a hot topic among investors and analysts. With the projectâ€™s unique "play-to-earn" mechanics and massive community engagement, speculation about its market performance has reached a fever pitch.  

## What Will Be the Price of Hamster Kombat?  

Crypto analyst Gautam Gupta has raised concerns about potential price volatility following the HMSTR listing. He predicts a possible short-term decline due to profit-taking by early adopters who participated in the airdrop campaign. This pattern is common in memecoins and play-to-earn projects, where initial hype drives rapid sell-offs.  

Gupta draws parallels between HMSTR and Notcoin (NOT), another tap-to-earn project that achieved a $700 million market cap on its first day of trading. By comparing tokenomics, HMSTRâ€™s total supply of 100 billion tokensâ€”with 63% immediately circulatingâ€”could position it for a market cap range of **$504 million to $567 million** at listing. This translates to an estimated trading range of **$0.008â€“$0.009 per token**.  

> **"If you hold 1,000 HMSTR tokens, their value could stabilize between $8â€“$9 after 3â€“4 months of consistent gameplay,"** Gupta explained on social media.  

However, Gupta warns about HMSTRâ€™s hype-driven nature, citing risks such as an inexperienced development team and unclear utility for the token. Meanwhile, crypto influencer Ajay predicts a broader price range of **$0.005â€“$0.01**, emphasizing the projectâ€™s speculative appeal over long-term fundamentals.  

### Tokenomics and Exchange Preparations  

The HMSTR airdrop has already demonstrated extraordinary participation, with over **198,065 users in the FDUSD pool** and **1.31 million in the BNB pool** on Binance Launchpool. This massive engagementâ€”totaling $14 billion in locked assetsâ€”highlights the communityâ€™s enthusiasm. The airdrop will distribute 3 billion tokens, concluding just hours before trading begins.

## HMSTRâ€™s Viral Growth on Telegram  

Hamster Kombatâ€™s success stems from its integration with Telegram, where users tap a virtual hamster to earn tokens. This gamified approach has attracted millions of daily active users, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. The projectâ€™s simplicityâ€”combined with the allure of free tokensâ€”has driven unprecedented adoption.  

The team plans to expand HMSTRâ€™s utility through partnerships and in-game purchases, though details remain vague. Critics argue this lack of clarity could hinder long-term adoption, especially if the token fails to deliver tangible value post-listing.

1. **High Volatility**: Airdrop hunters may dump tokens immediately after listing.  
2. **Team Anonymity**: Limited information about the development team raises trust concerns.  
3. **Regulatory Uncertainty**: Projects with unclear utility face increased scrutiny in some jurisdictions.
