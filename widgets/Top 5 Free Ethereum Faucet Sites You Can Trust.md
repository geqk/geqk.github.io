## How Ethereum Faucets Work  

Ethereum faucets operate like a digital "tap" dispensing micro amounts of ETH into your wallet. These rewards are funded by advertising revenue or affiliate partnerships. Hereâ€™s a simplified breakdown of the process:  

1. **Registration**: Create an account and link your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet).  
2. **Task Completion**: Engage in activities like solving CAPTCHAs, watching videos, or clicking ads.  
3. **Claim Rewards**: Earn ETH instantly or after a cooldown period.  
4. **Withdrawal**: Transfer earnings to your wallet once the minimum threshold is met.  

Most faucets use **microwallets** like FaucetPay or ExpressCrypto to manage micro-transactions efficiently. While individual payouts are small, consistent use across multiple platforms can lead to meaningful accumulation over time.  

### Why Use Ethereum Faucets?  
- **No investment required**: Earn ETH without trading or mining.  
- **Low barrier to entry**: Accessible to anyone with an internet connection.  
- **Educational value**: Learn wallet management and blockchain transactions.
