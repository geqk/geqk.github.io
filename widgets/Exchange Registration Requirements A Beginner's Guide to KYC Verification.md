## Why Exchange Registration Fails: Critical Documentation Checklist  

Recent data shows over 60% of registration attempts fail during the initial verification phase. The most common issues include:

   - **Required Elements**: Full face visibility, plain background, and document held in hand  
   - **Prohibited Elements**: Sunglasses, headwear (unless religious), and partial body shots  

3. **Timing Optimization**  
   Statistical analysis reveals submission timing affects approval rates:

## Platform Selection: Hidden Costs and Fee Structures  

While registration itself is typically free, users should consider these often-overlooked costs:  

| Cost Category        | Average Range       | Optimization Strategy                |  
|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|  
| Identity Verification | $0-$5               | Choose platforms with free KYC       |  
| Deposit Fees          | 0.1%-0.5%           | Use TRC20 network for USDT transfers |  
| Withdrawal Thresholds | $100-$500 minimum   | Accumulate balances before withdrawal|  

Pro Tip: Platforms supporting multiple blockchain networks (BTC, ETH, TRX) allow users to select the most cost-effective transfer option based on current network congestion.  

## Phone Number Alternatives: Registration Workarounds  

For users facing phone verification challenges, consider these verified methods:  

1. **Virtual Number Services**  
   - Google Voice (82% success rate)  
   - TextNow (65% success rate)  

2. **Alternative Verification Paths**  
   - Family member's verified number with synchronized KYC  
   - Prepaid international SIM cards (Thailand TrueMove recommended)  

3. **Email-Only Platforms**
