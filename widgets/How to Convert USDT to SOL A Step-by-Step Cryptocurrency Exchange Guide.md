After selecting your preferred exchange, complete the registration process:  

1. **Account Creation**: Provide basic information like email address and create a secure password.  
2. **KYC Verification**: Submit government-issued ID documents to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.  
3. **Security Setup**: Enable 2FA using apps like Google Authenticator for enhanced account protection.  

Verification typically takes 24-48 hours, after which you gain full access to deposit and trading functionalities.

Before initiating the conversion, transfer USDT to your exchange wallet:  

1. **Navigate to Deposit Section**: Locate the USDT deposit option in your exchange wallet.

3. **Copy Deposit Address**: Carefully copy the unique wallet address provided by the exchange.  
4. **Initiate Transfer**: Send USDT from your external wallet to this address.  

üîç **Pro Tip**: Always verify blockchain network compatibility to prevent fund loss.

With USDT in your exchange wallet, proceed to convert:  

1. **Access Trading Interface**: Search for the USDT/SOL trading pair.  
2. **Choose Order Type**:  
   - **Market Order**: Immediate execution at current market price  
   - **Limit Order**: Set specific price targets for conversion  
3. **Enter Amount**: Input the USDT amount you wish to exchange.  
4. **Review Transaction**: Confirm exchange rate, fees, and final SOL amount before execution.  

Transaction fees typically range from 0.1% to 0.5%, varying by platform and trading volume.
