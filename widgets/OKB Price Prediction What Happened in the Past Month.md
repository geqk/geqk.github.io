## FAQs: Addressing Key Questions  

### Q1: Why is OKB's 3-month performance bearish despite monthly gains?  
OKB's **-17.93% drop over three months** reflects macroeconomic pressures, including rising interest rates and regulatory scrutiny. Short-term rallies may stem from speculative trading or platform-specific updates, but sustained recovery depends on broader market stabilization.

High volatility (11.88) indicates **market uncertainty**. While it creates short-term risks, it also offers entry points for disciplined investors. Diversifying portfolios and setting stop-loss orders can mitigate exposure.
