# 3 Tokens to Watch for Unlocking in the First Week of July 2025  

As the cryptocurrency market enters the first week of July 2025, investors and traders are closely monitoring upcoming token unlocks for **SUI**, **ENA**, and **ZETA**. These unlocks represent significant shifts in token supply that could influence market dynamics and short-term price movements. Below is a detailed analysis of each token's unlock schedule, project background, and potential implications.  

## Understanding Token Unlocks and Market Impact  

Token unlocks occur when previously locked cryptocurrency tokens become tradable, often as part of a project's vesting schedule for team members, investors, or ecosystem development. While unlocks don't inherently mean tokens will be sold, they can increase sell pressure if holders decide to liquidate positions. For investors, tracking these events is crucial for anticipating market volatility.
