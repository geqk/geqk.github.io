# OKX C2C Certification Merchant Service Agreement

This document outlines the terms governing OKX's C2C Certification Merchant Program, designed to enhance transaction security and reliability for platform users. By applying for verification, users agree to these binding terms that operate under OKX's broader Service Terms framework.
