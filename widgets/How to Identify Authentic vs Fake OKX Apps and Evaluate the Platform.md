   - **Step 2**: Begin **Level 1 Verification** by entering your name and ID number.

## Simulation Trading vs. Real Trading  

### Key Differences  
Understanding the psychological and technical gaps between simulation and real trading helps users prepare for actual market conditions.  

| **Factor**               | **Simulation Trading**                     | **Real Trading**                          |  
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|  
| **Capital**              | Virtual funds (no real risk)               | Real money (emotional stakes)             |  
| **Psychology**           | Relaxed decision-making                    | High-pressure scenarios (fear/greed)      |  
| **Market Impact**        | No slippage or liquidity issues            | Real-time execution risks                 |  
| **Learning Curve**       | Ideal for beginners                        | Requires risk management strategies       |  

### Why K-Line Charts Differ  
Simulation mode often uses historical data, while real trading reflects live market volatility. For example, a simulated Bitcoin trade might show a stable trend, but real-world trades could face sudden price swings due to news events or liquidity gaps.
