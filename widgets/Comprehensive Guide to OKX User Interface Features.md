The **Portfolio** module provides a consolidated overview of holdings, including asset values across different currencies. This feature simplifies portfolio tracking and performance evaluation.

## Trading Execution Options  

OKX caters to varying risk appetites and trading styles through its execution options:  

### Spot Trading  
**Spot Trading** enables direct buying/selling of cryptocurrencies at current market prices. Its user-friendly design makes it ideal for beginners, while features like grid trading bots assist in optimizing returns.  

### Futures Trading  
For advanced traders, **Futures Trading** allows speculation on future asset prices. Leverage options (up to 100x) amplify potential profits but require disciplined risk management.  

### Margin Trading  
**Margin Trading** lets users borrow funds to increase position sizes. While this can magnify gains, it also heightens liquidation risks, necessitating cautious use of leverage.  

## Security Features  

OKX prioritizes asset protection through robust security measures:  

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)  
Enabling **2FA** adds an extra verification layer, requiring a time-based code from an authenticator app during login. This significantly reduces unauthorized access risks.  

### Withdrawal Protection  
Assets are stored in **cold wallets** for enhanced security, minimizing exposure to potential breaches. Withdrawal confirmations via email or SMS provide an additional safeguard.  

### Device Management  
The **Device Management** system tracks login activity across devices. Users can remotely log out suspicious sessions or revoke device access instantly.

### Withdrawal Flexibility

### Transaction History
